Roman Numeral Kata showing my TDD skills.

Feature 1 - Converting Arabic to Roman
We would like to be able to convert Arabic numbers into their Roman numeral equivalents. We just need some kind of program that can accept a numeric input and output the Roman numeral for the input number.

Feature 2 - Converting Roman to Arabic
The change from the Arabic numbering system to using Roman numerals has gone really well, all things considered. There is a slight issue in that sales of the latest games have dropped off, and when questioned people have said it's because they no longer know what the latest version is, as there's no easy to read number. To remedy this, we are going to install Roman numeral to Arabic number converters everywhere we sell games, so people can work out which is the latest game.
